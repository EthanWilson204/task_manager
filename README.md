# task_manager

This is a personal web application I am currently developing to keep track of tasks I wish to complete, learn Javascript + HTML + CSS, and test my skills as a student/junior developer.

The goal is to make a browser that saves tasks across authenticated browsing sessions while keeping track of time and deadlines.
